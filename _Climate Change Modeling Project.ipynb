      "The two most abundant gases (nitrogen and oxygen) comprise 99% of the atmosphere. Neither traps heat. By definition, all greenhouse gases are trace gases because they live in the remaining 1%. It's too bad the CO2 is naturally so sparse. If CO2 were naturally abundant like oxygen, our emissions wouldn't matter. We'd have a negligible impact. But because CO2 is naturally sparse, our emissions matter a lot. In fact, one-third of the CO2 in the atmosphere is due to human activity. We have to stop emitting and pull CO2 we've already emitted out of the atmosphere to stabilize the climate.\n",

      "The “greenhouse effect” is concerned with the infrared radiation given off by the earth. The sun’s radiation basically passes through the oxygen and nitrogen in the earth’s atmosphere and lands on the earth’s surface, where 70% of it is absorbed; 30% is reflected back into the atmosphere. Part of this radiation bounces off the greenhouse gases and returns to be absorbed by earth. The greenhouses gases (GHGs) are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (NO2) and methane (CH4).\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does CO2 remain in the atmosphere? This is a difficult question because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. From 65% to 80% of the CO2 that is released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of 50-200 years. The rest is removed over several hundred thousand years. According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, about 50% of CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years, another 30% will be removed within a few centuries and the remaining 20% may stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years. This means that if we could stop carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue to warm the climate for thousands of years. Methane (CH4), by contrast, persists for about 12 years. Thus, even though methane is 26 times more potent than carbon dioxide, its effect is relatively short-lived. Furthermore, methane has increased from 700 ppb in 1750 to 1893 ppb today; notice that is parts per billion, not parts per million.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are causing global warming, how much will the earth warm up by the year 2100? This depends upon how many billions of tons of carbon dioxide are being emitted into the atmosphere. As a general rule, about 1 trillion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (actually 975 billion) will translate to about 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide. Also, 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide translates to about 1.8 °F (1 °C) in global warming. This can be verified by the fact that pre-industrial carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm and is now about 405 ppm. During this period, the planet warmed up about 1 °C.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists have measured the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which corresponds to 1 ppm and have found that this corresponds to 7.8 billion metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Therefore, in order to increase the global temperature by 1 °C, you would need 125 x 7.8 billion or 975 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. A metric ton equals 1,000 kilograms (or 2.2 x 1,000 = 2,200 pounds); the U.S. is the only country in the world that does not use the metric ton. In 2016, the world pumped 36.1 billion metric tons (or 39.8 U.S. Gt) of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The average per capita emission of carbon dioxide is 7 metric tons per person per year. In the year 2100, there will be about 11 billion people. Therefore, in 2100, in a business-as-usual scenario, we can expect the world to emit 11 x 7 or 77 billion metric tons into the atmosphere per year or an average of 56.5 billion tons for the next 80 years, i.e., an accumulation of 4.52 trillion tons of CO2 by 2300.  Less 25% (1.13 Tt) due to carbon sinks (the oceans are almost saturated with CO2), the world will have an accumulation of 3.4Tt (4.52 – 1.13) of carbon in the atmosphere. Dividing 3.4 trillion tons of CO2 by 975 million = 3.48 °C (6.26 °F).  This means that the world will be 6.26 °F warmer in 2100 than it was in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in sea level comes from two distinct processes: water expansions (3.3 feet) due to the added 6.26 °F of increased temperature and melting ice, mainly from Greenland (.41 feet) and the Antarctica (.2 feet) or 3.91 total feet by 2100, as well as increased extraction of groundwater due to irrigation.   Although we do not usually notice it, water expands very slightly as it gets warmer. The second and potentially greater contribution to rising sea level comes from the melting of glacial ice. Antarctica has 90% of the ice, Greenland has 9% of the ice (2,931 trillion tons of ice) and the remaining 1% is tied up in continental glaciers, which except for the Himalayas will all melt by 2100.  If Greenland completely melts, it will raise the sea level by about 24 feet (7.2 meters).  If the Antarctica completely melts, it will add 200 feet (or 60 meters) to the sea level rise.   \n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 2100, I predict that fossil fuels will be almost depleted (coal may last until 2150) and that the temperature rise will level off. My model predicts that Greenland will be losing about 500 Gt of ice per year until the end of the century, resulting in about 0.41 feet of sea level rise by 2100.  In addition, the Antarctica will add another 0.2 feet of sea level rise. Adding this to the 3.3 feet for thermal warming results in a sea level rise of 3.9 feet.  Now add 2 feet due to melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) due to the collapse of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers and you have a 5.9 foot sea level rise by the end of the century.  NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) states that the oceans could rise 8 feet by 2100 under a worse-case scenario, namely a complete collapse of the WAIS.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What effect would a 5.9 foot sea level rise have on the U.S.? Miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas. About 2 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded if sea levels rise just 3 feet. If the sea level rises 6 feet, 6 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded. A new study predicts that as many as 13.1 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by 2100 if the sea level rises 5.9 feet (1.8 meters), which is what I expect to be the most likely scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to sea-level rise, global warming is contributing to increases in the spread of insect-borne illnesses and crop-damaging pests. For example, diseases such as Zika, dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes, which pick up these diseases by biting infected people and then spreading them to other people through subsequent bites. Research has shown that warmer temperatures shorten the incubation period, which means the disease can spread more rapidly. Warmer temperatures also tend to increase the geographic range of insects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global warming also translates into more extreme weather events because higher temperatures mean an increase in energy in the atmosphere and oceans; energy is what drives weather. While we cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming, we can tie an overall trend to global warming. It makes logical sense that warm ocean waters give birth to more intense weather. Generally, hurricanes cannot survive for long over sea surfaces that are cooler than about 79 °F (26 °C). The longer the ocean waters stay above 79 °F, the more opportunity there is for a hurricane to blossom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, global warming will result in more droughts, floods and water scarcity.  Demand for water has tripled during the past 50 years. Currently a half billion people live in a water-stressed country. By 2025, that number is expected to increase to about 3 billion. The vast majority of fresh water, about 70%, is used for agriculture. On the U.S. East Coast, much of the water supply comes from surface water, whereas most of the Midwest gets its water supply from a combination of surface waters and well water. The well water comes from underground aquifers such as the Ogallala Aquifer. At present rates of withdrawal, parts of the Ogallala Aquifer water will be available for irrigation for only another 10 to 20 years.\n",

If the temperature outside the earth's atmosphere is above the boiling point of water (approx. 120°C), is it not possible that an increase could affect the atmosphere. Also, heated cosmic radiation could affect the temperature. What comes to mind is the 'P' theory. In an outdoor public unheated pool, you come along a warm spot of water. (We all know what that means.) The solar system could be traveling through such a heated radiation cloud. The Milky Way galaxy has chaotic catastrophic events of stellar birth, life and death throughout. Clouds or jets of superheated radiation blasted into space. Well, we might be entering that space. But, closer to home, one just has to look at a frosted window, on a winter morning, as the light from the sun hits it. With temperatures below freezing, the sun's rays melts the frost.

They also promote wild sea level increases, but again look at the sea level graph with your thinking cap on. Again the WILD rise was way before man was influencing anything here on earth. My point being carbon isn't poison man has flourished the most during the warm periods. Man isn't causing the flooding from rising seal levels that is natural, at most man can influence the speed of an occurrence. We need to find alternative energy sources because we need energy, cheap energy sources. Cheap energy saves lives on this earth, expensive energy kills people. We can prepare for changing climate but we cannot use energy we cannot afford to use. We need causes to save ourselves, for instance did you know the Big coastal cities most run by Democrats while telling you you need to pay the green shaman to make your weather better and safer for you, they are still dumping their poisons into the ocean because it is cheaper than disposing of them properly on land? Out of sight out of mind except you and I both know this is poisoning our oceans. While they tell us coral reefs dying are caused by your use of energy and that red tides are from a mysterious origin, they dump chemicals into our oceans without one acknowledgement of the damage this is doing!

      "The “greenhouse effect” is concerned with the infrared radiation given off by the earth. The sun’s radiation basically passes through the oxygen and nitrogen in the earth’s atmosphere and lands on the earth’s surface, where 70% of it is absorbed; 30% is reflected back into the atmosphere. Part of this radiation bounces off the greenhouse gases and returns to be absorbed by earth. The greenhouses gases (GHGs) are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (NO2) and methane (CH4).\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does CO2 remain in the atmosphere? This is a difficult question because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. From 65% to 80% of the CO2 that is released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of 50-200 years. The rest is removed over several hundred thousand years. According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, about 50% of CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years, another 30% will be removed within a few centuries and the remaining 20% may stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years. This means that if we could stop carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue to warm the climate for thousands of years. Methane (CH4), by contrast, persists for about 12 years. Thus, even though methane is 26 times more potent than carbon dioxide, its effect is relatively short-lived. Furthermore, methane has increased from 700 ppb in 1750 to 1893 ppb today; notice that is parts per billion, not parts per million.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are causing global warming, how much will the earth warm up by the year 2100? This depends upon how many billions of tons of carbon dioxide are being emitted into the atmosphere. As a general rule, about 1 trillion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (actually 975 billion) will translate to about 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide. Also, 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide translates to about 1.8 °F (1 °C) in global warming. This can be verified by the fact that pre-industrial carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm and is now about 405 ppm. During this period, the planet warmed up about 1 °C.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists have measured the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which corresponds to 1 ppm and have found that this corresponds to 7.8 billion metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Therefore, in order to increase the global temperature by 1 °C, you would need 125 x 7.8 billion or 975 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. A metric ton equals 1,000 kilograms (or 2.2 x 1,000 = 2,200 pounds); the U.S. is the only country in the world that does not use the metric ton. In 2016, the world pumped 36.1 billion metric tons (or 39.8 U.S. Gt) of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The average per capita emission of carbon dioxide is 7 metric tons per person per year. In the year 2100, there will be about 11 billion people. Therefore, in 2100, in a business-as-usual scenario, we can expect the world to emit 11 x 7 or 77 billion metric tons into the atmosphere per year or an average of 56.5 billion tons for the next 80 years, i.e., an accumulation of 4.52 trillion tons of CO2 by 2300.  Less 25% (1.13 Tt) due to carbon sinks (the oceans are almost saturated with CO2), the world will have an accumulation of 3.4Tt (4.52 – 1.13) of carbon in the atmosphere. Dividing 3.4 trillion tons of CO2 by 975 million = 3.48 °C (6.26 °F).  This means that the world will be 6.26 °F warmer in 2100 than it was in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in sea level comes from two distinct processes: water expansions (3.3 feet) due to the added 6.26 °F of increased temperature and melting ice, mainly from Greenland (.41 feet) and the Antarctica (.2 feet) or 3.91 total feet by 2100, as well as increased extraction of groundwater due to irrigation.   Although we do not usually notice it, water expands very slightly as it gets warmer. The second and potentially greater contribution to rising sea level comes from the melting of glacial ice. Antarctica has 90% of the ice, Greenland has 9% of the ice (2,931 trillion tons of ice) and the remaining 1% is tied up in continental glaciers, which except for the Himalayas will all melt by 2100.  If Greenland completely melts, it will raise the sea level by about 24 feet (7.2 meters).  If the Antarctica completely melts, it will add 200 feet (or 60 meters) to the sea level rise.   \n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 2100, I predict that fossil fuels will be almost depleted (coal may last until 2150) and that the temperature rise will level off. My model predicts that Greenland will be losing about 500 Gt of ice per year until the end of the century, resulting in about 0.41 feet of sea level rise by 2100.  In addition, the Antarctica will add another 0.2 feet of sea level rise. Adding this to the 3.3 feet for thermal warming results in a sea level rise of 3.9 feet.  Now add 2 feet due to melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) due to the collapse of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers and you have a 5.9 foot sea level rise by the end of the century.  NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) states that the oceans could rise 8 feet by 2100 under a worse-case scenario, namely a complete collapse of the WAIS.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What effect would a 5.9 foot sea level rise have on the U.S.? Miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas. About 2 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded if sea levels rise just 3 feet. If the sea level rises 6 feet, 6 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded. A new study predicts that as many as 13.1 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by 2100 if the sea level rises 5.9 feet (1.8 meters), which is what I expect to be the most likely scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to sea-level rise, global warming is contributing to increases in the spread of insect-borne illnesses and crop-damaging pests. For example, diseases such as Zika, dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes, which pick up these diseases by biting infected people and then spreading them to other people through subsequent bites. Research has shown that warmer temperatures shorten the incubation period, which means the disease can spread more rapidly. Warmer temperatures also tend to increase the geographic range of insects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global warming also translates into more extreme weather events because higher temperatures mean an increase in energy in the atmosphere and oceans; energy is what drives weather. While we cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming, we can tie an overall trend to global warming. It makes logical sense that warm ocean waters give birth to more intense weather. Generally, hurricanes cannot survive for long over sea surfaces that are cooler than about 79 °F (26 °C). The longer the ocean waters stay above 79 °F, the more opportunity there is for a hurricane to blossom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, global warming will result in more droughts, floods and water scarcity.  Demand for water has tripled during the past 50 years. Currently a half billion people live in a water-stressed country. By 2025, that number is expected to increase to about 3 billion. The vast majority of fresh water, about 70%, is used for agriculture. On the U.S. East Coast, much of the water supply comes from surface water, whereas most of the Midwest gets its water supply from a combination of surface waters and well water. The well water comes from underground aquifers such as the Ogallala Aquifer. At present rates of withdrawal, parts of the Ogallala Aquifer water will be available for irrigation for only another 10 to 20 years.\n",
      "Is CO2 Earth's Thermostat?\n",
      "Carbon dioxide has little or nothing to do with global warming. CO2 Is currently traced at 400 ppm. That is one carbon-dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of the atmosphere. Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm, which is 4% of the total CO2 accumulated in a year. CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds, and there is not enough of it to drive climate change. It is thermodynamically impossible!\n",
      "Also, bear in mind, that water vapor is the earth's most abundant and effective Greenhouse Gas. CO2 is only 5% of the earth's CHG. Water vapor is 95% of the earth's GHG and holds heat far longer than CO2.\n",
      "Lastly, CO2 will increase only after temperatures rise (eg. El Nino) and oceans degas. Conversely, CO2 levels drop as temperatures cool. In other words, CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack thereof and therefore do not drive climate but follow climate.\n",
      "Clearly, CO2 is actually a thermometer and not a thermostat!\n",

According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, about 50% of CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years, another 30% will be removed within a few centuries and the remaining 20% may stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years. This means that if we could stop carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue to warm the climate for thousands of years. Methane (CH4), by contrast, persists for about 12 years. Thus, even though methane is 26 times more potent than carbon dioxide, its effect is relatively short-lived. Furthermore, methane has increased from 700 ppb in 1750 to 1893 ppb today; notice that is parts per billion, not parts per million.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are causing global warming, how much will the earth warm up by the year 2100? This depends upon how many billions of tons of carbon dioxide are being emitted into the atmosphere. As a general rule, about 1 trillion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (actually 975 billion) will translate to about 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide. Also, 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide translates to about 1.8 °F (1 °C) in global warming. This can be verified by the fact that pre-industrial carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm and is now about 405 ppm. During this period, the planet warmed up about 1 °C.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists have measured the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which corresponds to 1 ppm and have found that this corresponds to 7.8 billion metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Therefore, in order to increase the global temperature by 1 °C, you would need 125 x 7.8 billion or 975 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. A metric ton equals 1,000 kilograms (or 2.2 x 1,000 = 2,200 pounds); the U.S. is the only country in the world that does not use the metric ton. In 2016, the world pumped 36.1 billion metric tons (or 39.8 U.S. Gt) of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The average per capita emission of carbon dioxide is 7 metric tons per person per year. In the year 2100, there will be about 11 billion people. Therefore, in 2100, in a business-as-usual scenario, we can expect the world to emit 11 x 7 or 77 billion metric tons into the atmosphere per year or an average of 56.5 billion tons for the next 80 years, i.e., an accumulation of 4.52 trillion tons of CO2 by 2300.  Less 25% (1.13 Tt) due to carbon sinks (the oceans are almost saturated with CO2), the world will have an accumulation of 3.4Tt (4.52 – 1.13) of carbon in the atmosphere. Dividing 3.4 trillion tons of CO2 by 975 million = 3.48 °C (6.26 °F).  This means that the world will be 6.26 °F warmer in 2100 than it was in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in sea level comes from two distinct processes: water expansions (3.3 feet) due to the added 6.26 °F of increased temperature and melting ice, mainly from Greenland (.41 feet) and the Antarctica (.2 feet) or 3.91 total feet by 2100, as well as increased extraction of groundwater due to irrigation.   Although we do not usually notice it, water expands very slightly as it gets warmer. The second and potentially greater contribution to rising sea level comes from the melting of glacial ice. Antarctica has 90% of the ice, Greenland has 9% of the ice (2,931 trillion tons of ice) and the remaining 1% is tied up in continental glaciers, which except for the Himalayas will all melt by 2100.  If Greenland completely melts, it will raise the sea level by about 24 feet (7.2 meters).  If the Antarctica completely melts, it will add 200 feet (or 60 meters) to the sea level rise.   \n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 2100, I predict that fossil fuels will be almost depleted (coal may last until 2150) and that the temperature rise will level off. My model predicts that Greenland will be losing about 500 Gt of ice per year until the end of the century, resulting in about 0.41 feet of sea level rise by 2100.  In addition, the Antarctica will add another 0.2 feet of sea level rise. Adding this to the 3.3 feet for thermal warming results in a sea level rise of 3.9 feet.  Now add 2 feet due to melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) due to the collapse of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers and you have a 5.9 foot sea level rise by the end of the century.  NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) states that the oceans could rise 8 feet by 2100 under a worse-case scenario, namely a complete collapse of the WAIS.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What effect would a 5.9 foot sea level rise have on the U.S.? Miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas. About 2 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded if sea levels rise just 3 feet. If the sea level rises 6 feet, 6 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded. A new study predicts that as many as 13.1 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by 2100 if the sea level rises 5.9 feet (1.8 meters), which is what I expect to be the most likely scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to sea-level rise, global warming is contributing to increases in the spread of insect-borne illnesses and crop-damaging pests. For example, diseases such as Zika, dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes, which pick up these diseases by biting infected people and then spreading them to other people through subsequent bites. Research has shown that warmer temperatures shorten the incubation period, which means the disease can spread more rapidly. Warmer temperatures also tend to increase the geographic range of insects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global warming also translates into more extreme weather events because higher temperatures mean an increase in energy in the atmosphere and oceans; energy is what drives weather. While we cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming, we can tie an overall trend to global warming. It makes logical sense that warm ocean waters give birth to more intense weather. Generally, hurricanes cannot survive for long over sea surfaces that are cooler than about 79 °F (26 °C). The longer the ocean waters stay above 79 °F, the more opportunity there is for a hurricane to blossom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, global warming will result in more droughts, floods and water scarcity.  Demand for water has tripled during the past 50 years. Currently a half billion people live in a water-stressed country. By 2025, that number is expected to increase to about 3 billion. The vast majority of fresh water, about 70%, is used for agriculture. On the U.S. East Coast, much of the water supply comes from surface water, whereas most of the Midwest gets its water supply from a combination of surface waters and well water. The well water comes from underground aquifers such as the Ogallala Aquifer. At present rates of withdrawal, parts of the Ogallala Aquifer water will be available for irrigation for only another 10 to 20 years.\n",

The only requirement needed for this to happen and become a reality is rest. The world is spending billions on UNCERTAINTY to save this planet trying to cool it,but cooling it is not changing the amount of emissions on earth or in the atmosphere. Watching and reading all that is being,attempted and done is like watching the movie groundhog day. Trial and error,unknown results,uncertainty,knowing the damage and destruction,and doing it anyway. Repeat again and again and again. Why hasn’t there ever been a time promoting  no risk,effective solution to save planet earth eliminating the amount of emissions on and in the planet just by turning it all off? It is free and results are immediate. Maybe this will not change the amount of emissions in atmosphere from 10 yrs ago,but if earth got that rest 1 day a week it will absolutely rejuvenate all that is being used and needed for earth to be more efficient and effective. Stop experimenting with so much uncertainty that is potentially more destructive and jwork on promoting the world to give earth off on Sundays and shut it off! Maybe the results would be miraculous and would heal this planet quicker than we’d ever imagine. We will never know until it’s done. Make that your great experiment to save the planet.

If the temperature outside the earth's atmosphere is above the boiling point of water (approx. 120°C), is it not possible that an increase could affect the atmosphere. Also, heated cosmic radiation could affect the temperature. What comes to mind is the 'P' theory. In an outdoor public unheated pool, you come along a warm spot of water. (We all know what that means.) The solar system could be traveling through such a heated radiation cloud. The Milky Way galaxy has chaotic catastrophic events of stellar birth, life and death throughout. Clouds or jets of superheated radiation blasted into space. Well, we might be entering that space. But, closer to home, one just has to look at a frosted window, on a winter morning, as the light from the sun hits it. With temperatures below freezing, the sun's rays melts the frost.

      "\n",
      "Carbon dioxide (CO2) traps heat. So as the CO2 level in the air rises, the atmospheric temperature increases.  Which causes more CO2 to be released by the oceans.  Which raises the temperature some more. \n",

      "It’s a positive feedback loop.  \n",
      "\n",
      "When our orbit is in the cooler phase the temperature falls and the CO2 level slowly goes back down.  Cooling off takes longer than warming up. \n",
      "\n",
      "During ice ages, the CO2 level was 180 parts per million (ppm) and during warm spells, the CO2 has been 280 ppm.\n",

They also promote wild sea level increases, but again look at the sea level graph with your thinking cap on. Again the WILD rise was way before man was influencing anything here on earth. My point being carbon isn't poison man has flourished the most during the warm periods. Man isn't causing the flooding from rising seal levels that is natural, at most man can influence the speed of an occurrence. We need to find alternative energy sources because we need energy, cheap energy sources. Cheap energy saves lives on this earth, expensive energy kills people. We can prepare for changing climate but we cannot use energy we cannot afford to use. We need causes to save ourselves, for instance did you know the Big coastal cities most run by Democrats while telling you you need to pay the green shaman to make your weather better and safer for you, they are still dumping their poisons into the ocean because it is cheaper than disposing of them properly on land? Out of sight out of mind except you and I both know this is poisoning our oceans. While they tell us coral reefs dying are caused by your use of energy and that red tides are from a mysterious origin, they dump chemicals into our oceans without one acknowledgement of the damage this is doing!

      "The “greenhouse effect” is concerned with the infrared radiation given off by the earth. The sun’s radiation basically passes through the oxygen and nitrogen in the earth’s atmosphere and lands on the earth’s surface, where 70% of it is absorbed; 30% is reflected back into the atmosphere. Part of this radiation bounces off the greenhouse gases and returns to be absorbed by earth. The greenhouses gases (GHGs) are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (NO2) and methane (CH4).\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does CO2 remain in the atmosphere? This is a difficult question because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. From 65% to 80% of the CO2 that is released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of 50-200 years. The rest is removed over several hundred thousand years. According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, about 50% of CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years, another 30% will be removed within a few centuries and the remaining 20% may stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years. This means that if we could stop carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow, the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue to warm the climate for thousands of years. Methane (CH4), by contrast, persists for about 12 years. Thus, even though methane is 26 times more potent than carbon dioxide, its effect is relatively short-lived. Furthermore, methane has increased from 700 ppb in 1750 to 1893 ppb today; notice that is parts per billion, not parts per million.\n",

      "If the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are causing global warming, how much will the earth warm up by the year 2100? This depends upon how many billions of tons of carbon dioxide are being emitted into the atmosphere. As a general rule, about 1 trillion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (actually 975 billion) will translate to about 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide. Also, 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide translates to about 1.8 °F (1 °C) in global warming. This can be verified by the fact that pre-industrial carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm and is now about 405 ppm. During this period, the planet warmed up about 1 °C.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists have measured the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which corresponds to 1 ppm and have found that this corresponds to 7.8 billion metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Therefore, in order to increase the global temperature by 1 °C, you would need 125 x 7.8 billion or 975 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. A metric ton equals 1,000 kilograms (or 2.2 x 1,000 = 2,200 pounds); the U.S. is the only country in the world that does not use the metric ton. In 2016, the world pumped 36.1 billion metric tons (or 39.8 U.S. Gt) of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The average per capita emission of carbon dioxide is 7 metric tons per person per year. In the year 2100, there will be about 11 billion people. Therefore, in 2100, in a business-as-usual scenario, we can expect the world to emit 11 x 7 or 77 billion metric tons into the atmosphere per year or an average of 56.5 billion tons for the next 80 years, i.e., an accumulation of 4.52 trillion tons of CO2 by 2300.  Less 25% (1.13 Tt) due to carbon sinks (the oceans are almost saturated with CO2), the world will have an accumulation of 3.4Tt (4.52 – 1.13) of carbon in the atmosphere. Dividing 3.4 trillion tons of CO2 by 975 million = 3.48 °C (6.26 °F).  This means that the world will be 6.26 °F warmer in 2100 than it was in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in sea level comes from two distinct processes: water expansions (3.3 feet) due to the added 6.26 °F of increased temperature and melting ice, mainly from Greenland (.41 feet) and the Antarctica (.2 feet) or 3.91 total feet by 2100, as well as increased extraction of groundwater due to irrigation.   Although we do not usually notice it, water expands very slightly as it gets warmer. The second and potentially greater contribution to rising sea level comes from the melting of glacial ice. Antarctica has 90% of the ice, Greenland has 9% of the ice (2,931 trillion tons of ice) and the remaining 1% is tied up in continental glaciers, which except for the Himalayas will all melt by 2100.  If Greenland completely melts, it will raise the sea level by about 24 feet (7.2 meters).  If the Antarctica completely melts, it will add 200 feet (or 60 meters) to the sea level rise.   \n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 2100, I predict that fossil fuels will be almost depleted (coal may last until 2150) and that the temperature rise will level off. My model predicts that Greenland will be losing about 500 Gt of ice per year until the end of the century, resulting in about 0.41 feet of sea level rise by 2100.  In addition, the Antarctica will add another 0.2 feet of sea level rise. Adding this to the 3.3 feet for thermal warming results in a sea level rise of 3.9 feet.  Now add 2 feet due to melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) due to the collapse of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers and you have a 5.9 foot sea level rise by the end of the century.  NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) states that the oceans could rise 8 feet by 2100 under a worse-case scenario, namely a complete collapse of the WAIS.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What effect would a 5.9 foot sea level rise have on the U.S.? Miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas. About 2 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded if sea levels rise just 3 feet. If the sea level rises 6 feet, 6 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded. A new study predicts that as many as 13.1 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by 2100 if the sea level rises 5.9 feet (1.8 meters), which is what I expect to be the most likely scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to sea-level rise, global warming is contributing to increases in the spread of insect-borne illnesses and crop-damaging pests. For example, diseases such as Zika, dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes, which pick up these diseases by biting infected people and then spreading them to other people through subsequent bites. Research has shown that warmer temperatures shorten the incubation period, which means the disease can spread more rapidly. Warmer temperatures also tend to increase the geographic range of insects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global warming also translates into more extreme weather events because higher temperatures mean an increase in energy in the atmosphere and oceans; energy is what drives weather. While we cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming, we can tie an overall trend to global warming. It makes logical sense that warm ocean waters give birth to more intense weather. Generally, hurricanes cannot survive for long over sea surfaces that are cooler than about 79 °F (26 °C). The longer the ocean waters stay above 79 °F, the more opportunity there is for a hurricane to blossom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, global warming will result in more droughts, floods and water scarcity.  Demand for water has tripled during the past 50 years. Currently a half billion people live in a water-stressed country. By 2025, that number is expected to increase to about 3 billion. The vast majority of fresh water, about 70%, is used for agriculture. On the U.S. East Coast, much of the water supply comes from surface water, whereas most of the Midwest gets its water supply from a combination of surface waters and well water. The well water comes from underground aquifers such as the Ogallala Aquifer. At present rates of withdrawal, parts of the Ogallala Aquifer water will be available for irrigation for only another 10 to 20 years.\n",
      "Is CO2 Earth's Thermostat?\n",
      "Carbon dioxide has little or nothing to do with global warming. CO2 Is currently traced at 400 ppm. That is one carbon-dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of the atmosphere. Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm, which is 4% of the total CO2 accumulated in a year. CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds, and there is not enough of it to drive climate change. It is thermodynamically impossible!\n",
      "Also, bear in mind, that water vapor is the earth's most abundant and effective Greenhouse Gas. CO2 is only 5% of the earth's CHG. Water vapor is 95% of the earth's GHG and holds heat far longer than CO2.\n",
      "Lastly, CO2 will increase only after temperatures rise (eg. El Nino) and oceans degas. Conversely, CO2 levels drop as temperatures cool. In other words, CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack thereof and therefore do not drive climate but follow climate.\n",
      "Clearly, CO2 is actually a thermometer and not a thermostat!\n",

      "The “greenhouse effect  is concerned with the infrared radiation given off by the earth. The sun s radiation basically passes through the oxygen and nitrogen in the earth s atmosphere and lands on the earth s surface  where 70  of it is absorbed  30  is reflected back into the atmosphere. Part of this radiation bounces off the greenhouse gases and returns to be absorbed by earth. The greenhouses gases  GHGs  are water vapor  H2O   carbon dioxide  CO2   nitrous oxide  NO2  and methane  CH4 .\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does CO2 remain in the atmosphere  This is a difficult question because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. From 65  to 80  of the CO2 that is released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of 50 200 years. The rest is removed over several hundred thousand years. According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report  about 50  of CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years  another 30  will be removed within a few centuries and the remaining 20  may stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years. This means that if we could stop carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow  the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue to warm the climate for thousands of years. Methane  CH4   by contrast  persists for about 12 years. Thus  even though methane is 26 times more potent than carbon dioxide  its effect is relatively short lived. Furthermore  methane has increased from 700 ppb in 1750 to 1893 ppb today  notice that is parts per billion  not parts per million.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are causing global warming  how much will the earth warm up by the year 2100  This depends upon how many billions of tons of carbon dioxide are being emitted into the atmosphere. As a general rule  about 1 trillion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  actually 975 billion  will translate to about 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide. Also  125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide translates to about 1.8    1    in global warming. This can be verified by the fact that pre industrial carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm and is now about 405 ppm. During this period  the planet warmed up about 1  .\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists have measured the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which corresponds to 1 ppm and have found that this corresponds to 7.8 billion metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Therefore  in order to increase the global temperature by 1    you would need 125 x 7.8 billion or 975 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. A metric ton equals 1 000 kilograms  or 2.2 x 1 000   2 200 pounds   the U.S. is the only country in the world that does not use the metric ton. In 2016  the world pumped 36.1 billion metric tons  or 39.8 U.S. Gt  of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The average per capita emission of carbon dioxide is 7 metric tons per person per year. In the year 2100  there will be about 11 billion people. Therefore  in 2100  in a business as usual scenario  we can expect the world to emit 11 x 7 or 77 billion metric tons into the atmosphere per year or an average of 56.5 billion tons for the next 80 years  i.e.  an accumulation of 4.52 trillion tons of CO2 by 2300.  Less 25   1.13 Tt  due to carbon sinks  the oceans are almost saturated with CO2   the world will have an accumulation of 3.4Tt  4.52 – 1.13  of carbon in the atmosphere. Dividing 3.4 trillion tons of CO2 by 975 million   3.48    6.26   .  This means that the world will be 6.26   warmer in 2100 than it was in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in sea level comes from two distinct processes  water expansions  3.3 feet  due to the added 6.26   of increased temperature and melting ice  mainly from Greenland  .41 feet  and the Antarctica  .2 feet  or 3.91 total feet by 2100  as well as increased extraction of groundwater due to irrigation.   Although we do not usually notice it  water expands very slightly as it gets warmer. The second and potentially greater contribution to rising sea level comes from the melting of glacial ice. Antarctica has 90  of the ice  Greenland has 9  of the ice  2 931 trillion tons of ice  and the remaining 1  is tied up in continental glaciers  which except for the Himalayas will all melt by 2100.  If Greenland completely melts  it will raise the sea level by about 24 feet  7.2 meters .  If the Antarctica completely melts  it will add 200 feet  or 60 meters  to the sea level rise.   \n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 2100  I predict that fossil fuels will be almost depleted  coal may last until 2150  and that the temperature rise will level off. My model predicts that Greenland will be losing about 500 Gt of ice per year until the end of the century  resulting in about 0.41 feet of sea level rise by 2100.  In addition  the Antarctica will add another 0.2 feet of sea level rise. Adding this to the 3.3 feet for thermal warming results in a sea level rise of 3.9 feet.  Now add 2 feet due to melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  WAIS  due to the collapse of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers and you have a 5.9 foot sea level rise by the end of the century.  NOAA  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  states that the oceans could rise 8 feet by 2100 under a worse case scenario  namely a complete collapse of the WAIS.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What effect would a 5.9 foot sea level rise have on the U.S.  Miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas. About 2 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded if sea levels rise just 3 feet. If the sea level rises 6 feet  6 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded. A new study predicts that as many as 13.1 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by 2100 if the sea level rises 5.9 feet  1.8 meters   which is what I expect to be the most likely scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to sea level rise  global warming is contributing to increases in the spread of insect borne illnesses and crop damaging pests. For example  diseases such as Zika  dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes  which pick up these diseases by biting infected people and then spreading them to other people through subsequent bites. Research has shown that warmer temperatures shorten the incubation period  which means the disease can spread more rapidly. Warmer temperatures also tend to increase the geographic range of insects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global warming also translates into more extreme weather events because higher temperatures mean an increase in energy in the atmosphere and oceans  energy is what drives weather. While we cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming  we can tie an overall trend to global warming. It makes logical sense that warm ocean waters give birth to more intense weather. Generally  hurricanes cannot survive for long over sea surfaces that are cooler than about 79    26   . The longer the ocean waters stay above 79    the more opportunity there is for a hurricane to blossom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly  global warming will result in more droughts  floods and water scarcity.  Demand for water has tripled during the past 50 years. Currently a half billion people live in a water stressed country. By 2025  that number is expected to increase to about 3 billion. The vast majority of fresh water  about 70   is used for agriculture. On the U.S. East Coast  much of the water supply comes from surface water  whereas most of the Midwest gets its water supply from a combination of surface waters and well water. The well water comes from underground aquifers such as the Ogallala Aquifer. At present rates of withdrawal  parts of the Ogallala Aquifer water will be available for irrigation for only another 10 to 20 years.\n",

      "Dear world  if there was ever a time for the world to UNITE it would be now. I invite all on planet earth to join me giving our beautiful planet a day off 1 day a week on Sundays. The only requirement needed for this to happen and become a reality is rest. The world is spending billions on UNCERTAINTY to save this planet trying to cool it but cooling it is not changing the amount of emissions on earth or in the atmosphere. Watching and reading all that is being attempted and done is like watching the movie groundhog day. Trial and error unknown results uncertainty knowing the damage and destruction and doing it anyway. Repeat again and again and again. Why hasn t there ever been a time promoting  no risk effective solution to save planet earth eliminating the amount of emissions on and in the planet just by turning it all off  It is free and results are immediate. Maybe this will not change the amount of emissions in atmosphere from 10 yrs ago but if earth got that rest 1 day a week it will absolutely rejuvenate all that is being used and needed for earth to be more efficient and effective. Stop experimenting with so much uncertainty that is potentially more destructive and jwork on promoting the world to give earth off on Sundays and shut it off  Maybe the results would be miraculous and would heal this planet quicker than we d ever imagine. We will never know until it s done. Make that your great experiment to save the planet. There is no more time to waste and wildfires fires and wars only escalated the time left  We have to act immediately Knowing results not tomorrowS uncertainty  SHUT IT DOWN 1 day a week and NOW  Thanks. Spread the word \n",

If the temperature outside the earth s atmosphere is above the boiling point of water  approx. 120    is it not possible that an increase could affect the atmosphere. Also  heated cosmic radiation could affect the temperature. What comes to mind is the  P  theory. In an outdoor public unheated pool  you come along a warm spot of water.  We all know what that means.  The solar system could be traveling through such a heated radiation cloud. The Milky Way galaxy has chaotic catastrophic events of stellar birth  life and death throughout. Clouds or jets of superheated radiation blasted into space. Well  we might be entering that space. But  closer to home  one just has to look at a frosted window  on a winter morning  as the light from the sun hits it. With temperatures below freezing  the sun s rays melts the frost.

      "The “greenhouse effect  is concerned with the infrared radiation given off by the earth. The sun s radiation basically passes through the oxygen and nitrogen in the earth s atmosphere and lands on the earth s surface  where 70  of it is absorbed  30  is reflected back into the atmosphere. Part of this radiation bounces off the greenhouse gases and returns to be absorbed by earth. The greenhouses gases  GHGs  are water vapor  H2O   carbon dioxide  CO2   nitrous oxide  NO2  and methane  CH4 .\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does CO2 remain in the atmosphere  This is a difficult question because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. From 65  to 80  of the CO2 that is released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of 50 200 years. The rest is removed over several hundred thousand years. According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report  about 50  of CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years  another 30  will be removed within a few centuries and the remaining 20  may stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years. This means that if we could stop carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow  the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue to warm the climate for thousands of years. Methane  CH4   by contrast  persists for about 12 years. Thus  even though methane is 26 times more potent than carbon dioxide  its effect is relatively short lived. Furthermore  methane has increased from 700 ppb in 1750 to 1893 ppb today  notice that is parts per billion  not parts per million.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are causing global warming  how much will the earth warm up by the year 2100  This depends upon how many billions of tons of carbon dioxide are being emitted into the atmosphere. As a general rule  about 1 trillion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  actually 975 billion  will translate to about 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide. Also  125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide translates to about 1.8    1    in global warming. This can be verified by the fact that pre industrial carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm and is now about 405 ppm. During this period  the planet warmed up about 1  .\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists have measured the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which corresponds to 1 ppm and have found that this corresponds to 7.8 billion metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Therefore  in order to increase the global temperature by 1    you would need 125 x 7.8 billion or 975 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. A metric ton equals 1 000 kilograms  or 2.2 x 1 000   2 200 pounds   the U.S. is the only country in the world that does not use the metric ton. In 2016  the world pumped 36.1 billion metric tons  or 39.8 U.S. Gt  of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The average per capita emission of carbon dioxide is 7 metric tons per person per year. In the year 2100  there will be about 11 billion people. Therefore  in 2100  in a business as usual scenario  we can expect the world to emit 11 x 7 or 77 billion metric tons into the atmosphere per year or an average of 56.5 billion tons for the next 80 years  i.e.  an accumulation of 4.52 trillion tons of CO2 by 2300.  Less 25   1.13 Tt  due to carbon sinks  the oceans are almost saturated with CO2   the world will have an accumulation of 3.4Tt  4.52 – 1.13  of carbon in the atmosphere. Dividing 3.4 trillion tons of CO2 by 975 million   3.48    6.26   .  This means that the world will be 6.26   warmer in 2100 than it was in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in sea level comes from two distinct processes  water expansions  3.3 feet  due to the added 6.26   of increased temperature and melting ice  mainly from Greenland  .41 feet  and the Antarctica  .2 feet  or 3.91 total feet by 2100  as well as increased extraction of groundwater due to irrigation.   Although we do not usually notice it  water expands very slightly as it gets warmer. The second and potentially greater contribution to rising sea level comes from the melting of glacial ice. Antarctica has 90  of the ice  Greenland has 9  of the ice  2 931 trillion tons of ice  and the remaining 1  is tied up in continental glaciers  which except for the Himalayas will all melt by 2100.  If Greenland completely melts  it will raise the sea level by about 24 feet  7.2 meters .  If the Antarctica completely melts  it will add 200 feet  or 60 meters  to the sea level rise.   \n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 2100  I predict that fossil fuels will be almost depleted  coal may last until 2150  and that the temperature rise will level off. My model predicts that Greenland will be losing about 500 Gt of ice per year until the end of the century  resulting in about 0.41 feet of sea level rise by 2100.  In addition  the Antarctica will add another 0.2 feet of sea level rise. Adding this to the 3.3 feet for thermal warming results in a sea level rise of 3.9 feet.  Now add 2 feet due to melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  WAIS  due to the collapse of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers and you have a 5.9 foot sea level rise by the end of the century.  NOAA  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  states that the oceans could rise 8 feet by 2100 under a worse case scenario  namely a complete collapse of the WAIS.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What effect would a 5.9 foot sea level rise have on the U.S.  Miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas. About 2 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded if sea levels rise just 3 feet. If the sea level rises 6 feet  6 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded. A new study predicts that as many as 13.1 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by 2100 if the sea level rises 5.9 feet  1.8 meters   which is what I expect to be the most likely scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to sea level rise  global warming is contributing to increases in the spread of insect borne illnesses and crop damaging pests. For example  diseases such as Zika  dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes  which pick up these diseases by biting infected people and then spreading them to other people through subsequent bites. Research has shown that warmer temperatures shorten the incubation period  which means the disease can spread more rapidly. Warmer temperatures also tend to increase the geographic range of insects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global warming also translates into more extreme weather events because higher temperatures mean an increase in energy in the atmosphere and oceans  energy is what drives weather. While we cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming  we can tie an overall trend to global warming. It makes logical sense that warm ocean waters give birth to more intense weather. Generally  hurricanes cannot survive for long over sea surfaces that are cooler than about 79    26   . The longer the ocean waters stay above 79    the more opportunity there is for a hurricane to blossom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly  global warming will result in more droughts  floods and water scarcity.  Demand for water has tripled during the past 50 years. Currently a half billion people live in a water stressed country. By 2025  that number is expected to increase to about 3 billion. The vast majority of fresh water  about 70   is used for agriculture. On the U.S. East Coast  much of the water supply comes from surface water  whereas most of the Midwest gets its water supply from a combination of surface waters and well water. The well water comes from underground aquifers such as the Ogallala Aquifer. At present rates of withdrawal  parts of the Ogallala Aquifer water will be available for irrigation for only another 10 to 20 years.\n",
      "Is CO2 Earth s Thermostat \n",
      "Carbon dioxide has little or nothing to do with global warming. CO2 Is currently traced at 400 ppm. That is one carbon dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of the atmosphere. Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm  which is 4  of the total CO2 accumulated in a year. CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds  and there is not enough of it to drive climate change. It is thermodynamically impossible \n",
      "Also  bear in mind  that water vapor is the earth s most abundant and effective Greenhouse Gas. CO2 is only 5  of the earth s CHG. Water vapor is 95  of the earth s GHG and holds heat far longer than CO2.\n",
      "Lastly  CO2 will increase only after temperatures rise  eg. El Nino  and oceans degas. Conversely  CO2 levels drop as temperatures cool. In other words  CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack thereof and therefore do not drive climate but follow climate.\n",
      "Clearly  CO2 is actually a thermometer and not a thermostat \n",

      "The “greenhouse effect  is concerned with the infrared radiation given off by the earth. The sun s radiation basically passes through the oxygen and nitrogen in the earth s atmosphere and lands on the earth s surface  where 70  of it is absorbed  30  is reflected back into the atmosphere. Part of this radiation bounces off the greenhouse gases and returns to be absorbed by earth. The greenhouses gases  GHGs  are water vapor  H2O   carbon dioxide  CO2   nitrous oxide  NO2  and methane  CH4 .\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does CO2 remain in the atmosphere  This is a difficult question because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. From 65  to 80  of the CO2 that is released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of 50 200 years. The rest is removed over several hundred thousand years. According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report  about 50  of CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years  another 30  will be removed within a few centuries and the remaining 20  may stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years. This means that if we could stop carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow  the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue to warm the climate for thousands of years. Methane  CH4   by contrast  persists for about 12 years. Thus  even though methane is 26 times more potent than carbon dioxide  its effect is relatively short lived. Furthermore  methane has increased from 700 ppb in 1750 to 1893 ppb today  notice that is parts per billion  not parts per million.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are causing global warming  how much will the earth warm up by the year 2100  This depends upon how many billions of tons of carbon dioxide are being emitted into the atmosphere. As a general rule  about 1 trillion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  actually 975 billion  will translate to about 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide. Also  125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide translates to about 1.8    1    in global warming. This can be verified by the fact that pre industrial carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm and is now about 405 ppm. During this period  the planet warmed up about 1  .\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists have measured the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which corresponds to 1 ppm and have found that this corresponds to 7.8 billion metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Therefore  in order to increase the global temperature by 1    you would need 125 x 7.8 billion or 975 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. A metric ton equals 1 000 kilograms  or 2.2 x 1 000   2 200 pounds   the U.S. is the only country in the world that does not use the metric ton. In 2016  the world pumped 36.1 billion metric tons  or 39.8 U.S. Gt  of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The average per capita emission of carbon dioxide is 7 metric tons per person per year. In the year 2100  there will be about 11 billion people. Therefore  in 2100  in a business as usual scenario  we can expect the world to emit 11 x 7 or 77 billion metric tons into the atmosphere per year or an average of 56.5 billion tons for the next 80 years  i.e.  an accumulation of 4.52 trillion tons of CO2 by 2300.  Less 25   1.13 Tt  due to carbon sinks  the oceans are almost saturated with CO2   the world will have an accumulation of 3.4Tt  4.52 – 1.13  of carbon in the atmosphere. Dividing 3.4 trillion tons of CO2 by 975 million   3.48    6.26   .  This means that the world will be 6.26   warmer in 2100 than it was in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in sea level comes from two distinct processes  water expansions  3.3 feet  due to the added 6.26   of increased temperature and melting ice  mainly from Greenland  .41 feet  and the Antarctica  .2 feet  or 3.91 total feet by 2100  as well as increased extraction of groundwater due to irrigation.   Although we do not usually notice it  water expands very slightly as it gets warmer. The second and potentially greater contribution to rising sea level comes from the melting of glacial ice. Antarctica has 90  of the ice  Greenland has 9  of the ice  2 931 trillion tons of ice  and the remaining 1  is tied up in continental glaciers  which except for the Himalayas will all melt by 2100.  If Greenland completely melts  it will raise the sea level by about 24 feet  7.2 meters .  If the Antarctica completely melts  it will add 200 feet  or 60 meters  to the sea level rise.   \n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 2100  I predict that fossil fuels will be almost depleted  coal may last until 2150  and that the temperature rise will level off. My model predicts that Greenland will be losing about 500 Gt of ice per year until the end of the century  resulting in about 0.41 feet of sea level rise by 2100.  In addition  the Antarctica will add another 0.2 feet of sea level rise. Adding this to the 3.3 feet for thermal warming results in a sea level rise of 3.9 feet.  Now add 2 feet due to melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  WAIS  due to the collapse of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers and you have a 5.9 foot sea level rise by the end of the century.  NOAA  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  states that the oceans could rise 8 feet by 2100 under a worse case scenario  namely a complete collapse of the WAIS.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What effect would a 5.9 foot sea level rise have on the U.S.  Miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas. About 2 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded if sea levels rise just 3 feet. If the sea level rises 6 feet  6 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded. A new study predicts that as many as 13.1 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by 2100 if the sea level rises 5.9 feet  1.8 meters   which is what I expect to be the most likely scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to sea level rise  global warming is contributing to increases in the spread of insect borne illnesses and crop damaging pests. For example  diseases such as Zika  dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes  which pick up these diseases by biting infected people and then spreading them to other people through subsequent bites. Research has shown that warmer temperatures shorten the incubation period  which means the disease can spread more rapidly. Warmer temperatures also tend to increase the geographic range of insects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global warming also translates into more extreme weather events because higher temperatures mean an increase in energy in the atmosphere and oceans  energy is what drives weather. While we cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming  we can tie an overall trend to global warming. It makes logical sense that warm ocean waters give birth to more intense weather. Generally  hurricanes cannot survive for long over sea surfaces that are cooler than about 79    26   . The longer the ocean waters stay above 79    the more opportunity there is for a hurricane to blossom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly  global warming will result in more droughts  floods and water scarcity.  Demand for water has tripled during the past 50 years. Currently a half billion people live in a water stressed country. By 2025  that number is expected to increase to about 3 billion. The vast majority of fresh water  about 70   is used for agriculture. On the U.S. East Coast  much of the water supply comes from surface water  whereas most of the Midwest gets its water supply from a combination of surface waters and well water. The well water comes from underground aquifers such as the Ogallala Aquifer. At present rates of withdrawal  parts of the Ogallala Aquifer water will be available for irrigation for only another 10 to 20 years.\n",

If the temperature outside the earth s atmosphere is above the boiling point of water  approx. 120    is it not possible that an increase could affect the atmosphere. Also  heated cosmic radiation could affect the temperature. What comes to mind is the  P  theory. In an outdoor public unheated pool  you come along a warm spot of water.  We all know what that means.  The solar system could be traveling through such a heated radiation cloud. The Milky Way galaxy has chaotic catastrophic events of stellar birth  life and death throughout. Clouds or jets of superheated radiation blasted into space. Well  we might be entering that space.

      "The “greenhouse effect  is concerned with the infrared radiation given off by the earth. The sun s radiation basically passes through the oxygen and nitrogen in the earth s atmosphere and lands on the earth s surface  where 70  of it is absorbed  30  is reflected back into the atmosphere. Part of this radiation bounces off the greenhouse gases and returns to be absorbed by earth. The greenhouses gases  GHGs  are water vapor  H2O   carbon dioxide  CO2   nitrous oxide  NO2  and methane  CH4 .\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does CO2 remain in the atmosphere  This is a difficult question because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. From 65  to 80  of the CO2 that is released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of 50 200 years. The rest is removed over several hundred thousand years. According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report  about 50  of CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years  another 30  will be removed within a few centuries and the remaining 20  may stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years. This means that if we could stop carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow  the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue to warm the climate for thousands of years. Methane  CH4   by contrast  persists for about 12 years. Thus  even though methane is 26 times more potent than carbon dioxide  its effect is relatively short lived. Furthermore  methane has increased from 700 ppb in 1750 to 1893 ppb today  notice that is parts per billion  not parts per million.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are causing global warming  how much will the earth warm up by the year 2100  This depends upon how many billions of tons of carbon dioxide are being emitted into the atmosphere. As a general rule  about 1 trillion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  actually 975 billion  will translate to about 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide. Also  125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide translates to about 1.8    1    in global warming. This can be verified by the fact that pre industrial carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm and is now about 405 ppm. During this period  the planet warmed up about 1  .\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists have measured the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which corresponds to 1 ppm and have found that this corresponds to 7.8 billion metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Therefore  in order to increase the global temperature by 1    you would need 125 x 7.8 billion or 975 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. A metric ton equals 1 000 kilograms  or 2.2 x 1 000   2 200 pounds   the U.S. is the only country in the world that does not use the metric ton. In 2016  the world pumped 36.1 billion metric tons  or 39.8 U.S. Gt  of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The average per capita emission of carbon dioxide is 7 metric tons per person per year. In the year 2100  there will be about 11 billion people. Therefore  in 2100  in a business as usual scenario  we can expect the world to emit 11 x 7 or 77 billion metric tons into the atmosphere per year or an average of 56.5 billion tons for the next 80 years  i.e.  an accumulation of 4.52 trillion tons of CO2 by 2300.  Less 25   1.13 Tt  due to carbon sinks  the oceans are almost saturated with CO2   the world will have an accumulation of 3.4Tt  4.52 – 1.13  of carbon in the atmosphere. Dividing 3.4 trillion tons of CO2 by 975 million   3.48    6.26   .  This means that the world will be 6.26   warmer in 2100 than it was in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in sea level comes from two distinct processes  water expansions  3.3 feet  due to the added 6.26   of increased temperature and melting ice  mainly from Greenland  .41 feet  and the Antarctica  .2 feet  or 3.91 total feet by 2100  as well as increased extraction of groundwater due to irrigation.   Although we do not usually notice it  water expands very slightly as it gets warmer. The second and potentially greater contribution to rising sea level comes from the melting of glacial ice. Antarctica has 90  of the ice  Greenland has 9  of the ice  2 931 trillion tons of ice  and the remaining 1  is tied up in continental glaciers  which except for the Himalayas will all melt by 2100.  If Greenland completely melts  it will raise the sea level by about 24 feet  7.2 meters .  If the Antarctica completely melts  it will add 200 feet  or 60 meters  to the sea level rise.   \n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 2100  I predict that fossil fuels will be almost depleted  coal may last until 2150  and that the temperature rise will level off. My model predicts that Greenland will be losing about 500 Gt of ice per year until the end of the century  resulting in about 0.41 feet of sea level rise by 2100.  In addition  the Antarctica will add another 0.2 feet of sea level rise. Adding this to the 3.3 feet for thermal warming results in a sea level rise of 3.9 feet.  Now add 2 feet due to melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  WAIS  due to the collapse of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers and you have a 5.9 foot sea level rise by the end of the century.  NOAA  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  states that the oceans could rise 8 feet by 2100 under a worse case scenario  namely a complete collapse of the WAIS.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What effect would a 5.9 foot sea level rise have on the U.S.  Miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas. About 2 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded if sea levels rise just 3 feet. If the sea level rises 6 feet  6 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded. A new study predicts that as many as 13.1 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by 2100 if the sea level rises 5.9 feet  1.8 meters   which is what I expect to be the most likely scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to sea level rise  global warming is contributing to increases in the spread of insect borne illnesses and crop damaging pests. For example  diseases such as Zika  dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes  which pick up these diseases by biting infected people and then spreading them to other people through subsequent bites. Research has shown that warmer temperatures shorten the incubation period  which means the disease can spread more rapidly. Warmer temperatures also tend to increase the geographic range of insects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global warming also translates into more extreme weather events because higher temperatures mean an increase in energy in the atmosphere and oceans  energy is what drives weather. While we cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming  we can tie an overall trend to global warming. It makes logical sense that warm ocean waters give birth to more intense weather. Generally  hurricanes cannot survive for long over sea surfaces that are cooler than about 79    26   . The longer the ocean waters stay above 79    the more opportunity there is for a hurricane to blossom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly  global warming will result in more droughts  floods and water scarcity.  Demand for water has tripled during the past 50 years. Currently a half billion people live in a water stressed country. By 2025  that number is expected to increase to about 3 billion. The vast majority of fresh water  about 70   is used for agriculture. On the U.S. East Coast  much of the water supply comes from surface water  whereas most of the Midwest gets its water supply from a combination of surface waters and well water. The well water comes from underground aquifers such as the Ogallala Aquifer. At present rates of withdrawal  parts of the Ogallala Aquifer water will be available for irrigation for only another 10 to 20 years.\n",
      "Is CO2 Earth s Thermostat \n",
      "Carbon dioxide has little or nothing to do with global warming. CO2 Is currently traced at 400 ppm. That is one carbon dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of the atmosphere. Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm  which is 4  of the total CO2 accumulated in a year. CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds  and there is not enough of it to drive climate change. It is thermodynamically impossible \n",
      "Also  bear in mind  that water vapor is the earth s most abundant and effective Greenhouse Gas. CO2 is only 5  of the earth s CHG. Water vapor is 95  of the earth s GHG and holds heat far longer than CO2.\n",
      "Lastly  CO2 will increase only after temperatures rise  eg. El Nino  and oceans degas. Conversely  CO2 levels drop as temperatures cool. In other words  CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack thereof and therefore do not drive climate but follow climate.\n",

      "The “greenhouse effect  is concerned with the infrared radiation given off by the earth. The sun s radiation basically passes through the oxygen and nitrogen in the earth s atmosphere and lands on the earth s surface  where 70  of it is absorbed  30  is reflected back into the atmosphere. Part of this radiation bounces off the greenhouse gases and returns to be absorbed by earth. The greenhouses gases  GHGs  are water vapor  H2O   carbon dioxide  CO2   nitrous oxide  NO2  and methane  CH4 .\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does CO2 remain in the atmosphere  This is a difficult question because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. From 65  to 80  of the CO2 that is released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of 50 200 years. The rest is removed over several hundred thousand years. According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report  about 50  of CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years  another 30  will be removed within a few centuries and the remaining 20  may stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years. This means that if we could stop carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow  the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue to warm the climate for thousands of years. Methane  CH4   by contrast  persists for about 12 years. Thus  even though methane is 26 times more potent than carbon dioxide  its effect is relatively short lived. Furthermore  methane has increased from 700 ppb in 1750 to 1893 ppb today  notice that is parts per billion  not parts per million.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are causing global warming  how much will the earth warm up by the year 2100  This depends upon how many billions of tons of carbon dioxide are being emitted into the atmosphere. As a general rule  about 1 trillion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  actually 975 billion  will translate to about 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide. Also  125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide translates to about 1.8    1    in global warming. This can be verified by the fact that pre industrial carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm and is now about 405 ppm. During this period  the planet warmed up about 1  .\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists have measured the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which corresponds to 1 ppm and have found that this corresponds to 7.8 billion metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Therefore  in order to increase the global temperature by 1    you would need 125 x 7.8 billion or 975 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. A metric ton equals 1 000 kilograms  or 2.2 x 1 000   2 200 pounds   the U.S. is the only country in the world that does not use the metric ton. In 2016  the world pumped 36.1 billion metric tons  or 39.8 U.S. Gt  of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The average per capita emission of carbon dioxide is 7 metric tons per person per year. In the year 2100  there will be about 11 billion people. Therefore  in 2100  in a business as usual scenario  we can expect the world to emit 11 x 7 or 77 billion metric tons into the atmosphere per year or an average of 56.5 billion tons for the next 80 years  i.e.  an accumulation of 4.52 trillion tons of CO2 by 2300.  Less 25   1.13 Tt  due to carbon sinks  the oceans are almost saturated with CO2   the world will have an accumulation of 3.4Tt  4.52 – 1.13  of carbon in the atmosphere. Dividing 3.4 trillion tons of CO2 by 975 million   3.48    6.26   .  This means that the world will be 6.26   warmer in 2100 than it was in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in sea level comes from two distinct processes  water expansions  3.3 feet  due to the added 6.26   of increased temperature and melting ice  mainly from Greenland  .41 feet  and the Antarctica  .2 feet  or 3.91 total feet by 2100  as well as increased extraction of groundwater due to irrigation.   Although we do not usually notice it  water expands very slightly as it gets warmer. The second and potentially greater contribution to rising sea level comes from the melting of glacial ice. Antarctica has 90  of the ice  Greenland has 9  of the ice  2 931 trillion tons of ice  and the remaining 1  is tied up in continental glaciers  which except for the Himalayas will all melt by 2100.  If Greenland completely melts  it will raise the sea level by about 24 feet  7.2 meters .  If the Antarctica completely melts  it will add 200 feet  or 60 meters  to the sea level rise.   \n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 2100  I predict that fossil fuels will be almost depleted  coal may last until 2150  and that the temperature rise will level off. My model predicts that Greenland will be losing about 500 Gt of ice per year until the end of the century  resulting in about 0.41 feet of sea level rise by 2100.  In addition  the Antarctica will add another 0.2 feet of sea level rise. Adding this to the 3.3 feet for thermal warming results in a sea level rise of 3.9 feet.  Now add 2 feet due to melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  WAIS  due to the collapse of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers and you have a 5.9 foot sea level rise by the end of the century.  NOAA  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  states that the oceans could rise 8 feet by 2100 under a worse case scenario  namely a complete collapse of the WAIS.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What effect would a 5.9 foot sea level rise have on the U.S.  Miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas. About 2 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded if sea levels rise just 3 feet. If the sea level rises 6 feet  6 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded. A new study predicts that as many as 13.1 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by 2100 if the sea level rises 5.9 feet  1.8 meters   which is what I expect to be the most likely scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to sea level rise  global warming is contributing to increases in the spread of insect borne illnesses and crop damaging pests. For example  diseases such as Zika  dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes  which pick up these diseases by biting infected people and then spreading them to other people through subsequent bites. Research has shown that warmer temperatures shorten the incubation period  which means the disease can spread more rapidly. Warmer temperatures also tend to increase the geographic range of insects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global warming also translates into more extreme weather events because higher temperatures mean an increase in energy in the atmosphere and oceans  energy is what drives weather. While we cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming  we can tie an overall trend to global warming. It makes logical sense that warm ocean waters give birth to more intense weather. Generally  hurricanes cannot survive for long over sea surfaces that are cooler than about 79    26   . The longer the ocean waters stay above 79    the more opportunity there is for a hurricane to blossom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly  global warming will result in more droughts  floods and water scarcity.  Demand for water has tripled during the past 50 years. Currently a half billion people live in a water stressed country. By 2025  that number is expected to increase to about 3 billion. The vast majority of fresh water  about 70   is used for agriculture. On the U.S. East Coast  much of the water supply comes from surface water  whereas most of the Midwest gets its water supply from a combination of surface waters and well water. The well water comes from underground aquifers such as the Ogallala Aquifer. At present rates of withdrawal  parts of the Ogallala Aquifer water will be available for irrigation for only another 10 to 20 years.\n",

If the temperature outside the earth s atmosphere is above the boiling point of water  approx. 120    is it not possible that an increase could affect the atmosphere. Also  heated cosmic radiation could affect the temperature. What comes to mind is the  P  theory. In an outdoor public unheated pool  you come along a warm spot of water.  We all know what that means.  The solar system could be traveling through such a heated radiation cloud. The Milky Way galaxy has chaotic catastrophic events of stellar birth  life and death throughout. Clouds or jets of superheated radiation blasted into space. Well  we might be entering that space.

      "The “greenhouse effect  is concerned with the infrared radiation given off by the earth. The sun s radiation basically passes through the oxygen and nitrogen in the earth s atmosphere and lands on the earth s surface  where 70  of it is absorbed  30  is reflected back into the atmosphere. Part of this radiation bounces off the greenhouse gases and returns to be absorbed by earth. The greenhouses gases  GHGs  are water vapor  H2O   carbon dioxide  CO2   nitrous oxide  NO2  and methane  CH4 .\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does CO2 remain in the atmosphere  This is a difficult question because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. From 65  to 80  of the CO2 that is released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of 50 200 years. The rest is removed over several hundred thousand years. According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report  about 50  of CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years  another 30  will be removed within a few centuries and the remaining 20  may stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years. This means that if we could stop carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow  the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue to warm the climate for thousands of years. Methane  CH4   by contrast  persists for about 12 years. Thus  even though methane is 26 times more potent than carbon dioxide  its effect is relatively short lived. Furthermore  methane has increased from 700 ppb in 1750 to 1893 ppb today  notice that is parts per billion  not parts per million.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are causing global warming  how much will the earth warm up by the year 2100  This depends upon how many billions of tons of carbon dioxide are being emitted into the atmosphere. As a general rule  about 1 trillion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  actually 975 billion  will translate to about 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide. Also  125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide translates to about 1.8    1    in global warming. This can be verified by the fact that pre industrial carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm and is now about 405 ppm. During this period  the planet warmed up about 1  .\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists have measured the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which corresponds to 1 ppm and have found that this corresponds to 7.8 billion metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Therefore  in order to increase the global temperature by 1    you would need 125 x 7.8 billion or 975 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. A metric ton equals 1 000 kilograms  or 2.2 x 1 000   2 200 pounds   the U.S. is the only country in the world that does not use the metric ton. In 2016  the world pumped 36.1 billion metric tons  or 39.8 U.S. Gt  of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The average per capita emission of carbon dioxide is 7 metric tons per person per year. In the year 2100  there will be about 11 billion people. Therefore  in 2100  in a business as usual scenario  we can expect the world to emit 11 x 7 or 77 billion metric tons into the atmosphere per year or an average of 56.5 billion tons for the next 80 years  i.e.  an accumulation of 4.52 trillion tons of CO2 by 2300.  Less 25   1.13 Tt  due to carbon sinks  the oceans are almost saturated with CO2   the world will have an accumulation of 3.4Tt  4.52 – 1.13  of carbon in the atmosphere. Dividing 3.4 trillion tons of CO2 by 975 million   3.48    6.26   .  This means that the world will be 6.26   warmer in 2100 than it was in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in sea level comes from two distinct processes  water expansions  3.3 feet  due to the added 6.26   of increased temperature and melting ice  mainly from Greenland  .41 feet  and the Antarctica  .2 feet  or 3.91 total feet by 2100  as well as increased extraction of groundwater due to irrigation.   Although we do not usually notice it  water expands very slightly as it gets warmer. The second and potentially greater contribution to rising sea level comes from the melting of glacial ice. Antarctica has 90  of the ice  Greenland has 9  of the ice  2 931 trillion tons of ice  and the remaining 1  is tied up in continental glaciers  which except for the Himalayas will all melt by 2100.  If Greenland completely melts  it will raise the sea level by about 24 feet  7.2 meters .  If the Antarctica completely melts  it will add 200 feet  or 60 meters  to the sea level rise.   \n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 2100  I predict that fossil fuels will be almost depleted  coal may last until 2150  and that the temperature rise will level off. My model predicts that Greenland will be losing about 500 Gt of ice per year until the end of the century  resulting in about 0.41 feet of sea level rise by 2100.  In addition  the Antarctica will add another 0.2 feet of sea level rise. Adding this to the 3.3 feet for thermal warming results in a sea level rise of 3.9 feet.  Now add 2 feet due to melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  WAIS  due to the collapse of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers and you have a 5.9 foot sea level rise by the end of the century.  NOAA  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  states that the oceans could rise 8 feet by 2100 under a worse case scenario  namely a complete collapse of the WAIS.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What effect would a 5.9 foot sea level rise have on the U.S.  Miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas. About 2 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded if sea levels rise just 3 feet. If the sea level rises 6 feet  6 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded. A new study predicts that as many as 13.1 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by 2100 if the sea level rises 5.9 feet  1.8 meters   which is what I expect to be the most likely scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to sea level rise  global warming is contributing to increases in the spread of insect borne illnesses and crop damaging pests. For example  diseases such as Zika  dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes  which pick up these diseases by biting infected people and then spreading them to other people through subsequent bites. Research has shown that warmer temperatures shorten the incubation period  which means the disease can spread more rapidly. Warmer temperatures also tend to increase the geographic range of insects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global warming also translates into more extreme weather events because higher temperatures mean an increase in energy in the atmosphere and oceans  energy is what drives weather. While we cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming  we can tie an overall trend to global warming. It makes logical sense that warm ocean waters give birth to more intense weather. Generally  hurricanes cannot survive for long over sea surfaces that are cooler than about 79    26   . The longer the ocean waters stay above 79    the more opportunity there is for a hurricane to blossom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly  global warming will result in more droughts  floods and water scarcity.  Demand for water has tripled during the past 50 years. Currently a half billion people live in a water stressed country. By 2025  that number is expected to increase to about 3 billion. The vast majority of fresh water  about 70   is used for agriculture. On the U.S. East Coast  much of the water supply comes from surface water  whereas most of the Midwest gets its water supply from a combination of surface waters and well water. The well water comes from underground aquifers such as the Ogallala Aquifer. At present rates of withdrawal  parts of the Ogallala Aquifer water will be available for irrigation for only another 10 to 20 years.\n",
      "Is CO2 Earth s Thermostat \n",
      "Carbon dioxide has little or nothing to do with global warming. CO2 Is currently traced at 400 ppm. That is one carbon dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of the atmosphere. Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm  which is 4  of the total CO2 accumulated in a year. CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds  and there is not enough of it to drive climate change. It is thermodynamically impossible \n",
      "Also  bear in mind  that water vapor is the earth s most abundant and effective Greenhouse Gas. CO2 is only 5  of the earth s CHG. Water vapor is 95  of the earth s GHG and holds heat far longer than CO2.\n",
      "Lastly  CO2 will increase only after temperatures rise  eg. El Nino  and oceans degas. Conversely  CO2 levels drop as temperatures cool. In other words  CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack thereof and therefore do not drive climate but follow climate.\n",
      "Clearly  CO2 is actually a thermometer and not a thermostat \n",

      "14 The two most abundant gases  nitrogen and oxygen  comprise 99  of the atmosphere. Neither traps heat. By definition  all greenhouse gases are trace gases because they live in the remaining 1 . It s too bad the CO2 is naturally so sparse. If CO2 were naturally abundant like oxygen  our emissions wouldn t matter. We d have a negligible impact. But because CO2 is naturally sparse  our emissions matter a lot. In fact  one third of the CO2 in the atmosphere is due to human activity. We have to stop emitting and pull CO2 we ve already emitted out of the atmosphere to stabilize the climate.\n",

      "45 The  greenhouse effect  is concerned with the infrared radiation given off by the earth. The sun s radiation basically passes through the oxygen and nitrogen in the earth s atmosphere and lands on the earth s surface  where 70  of it is absorbed  30  is reflected back into the atmosphere. Part of this radiation bounces off the greenhouse gases and returns to be absorbed by earth. The greenhouses gases  GHGs  are water vapor  H2O   carbon dioxide  CO2   nitrous oxide  NO2  and methane  CH4 .\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does CO2 remain in the atmosphere  This is a difficult question because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. From 65  to 80  of the CO2 that is released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of 50 200 years. The rest is removed over several hundred thousand years. According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report  about 50  of CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years  another 30  will be removed within a few centuries and the remaining 20  may stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years. This means that if we could stop carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow  the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue to warm the climate for thousands of years. Methane  CH4   by contrast  persists for about 12 years. Thus  even though methane is 26 times more potent than carbon dioxide  its effect is relatively short lived. Furthermore  methane has increased from 700 ppb in 1750 to 1893 ppb today  notice that is parts per billion  not parts per million.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are causing global warming  how much will the earth warm up by the year 2100  This depends upon how many billions of tons of carbon dioxide are being emitted into the atmosphere. As a general rule  about 1 trillion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  actually 975 billion  will translate to about 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide. Also  125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide translates to about 1.8    1    in global warming. This can be verified by the fact that pre industrial carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm and is now about 405 ppm. During this period  the planet warmed up about 1  .\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists have measured the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which corresponds to 1 ppm and have found that this corresponds to 7.8 billion metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Therefore  in order to increase the global temperature by 1    you would need 125 x 7.8 billion or 975 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. A metric ton equals 1 000 kilograms  or 2.2 x 1 000   2 200 pounds   the U.S. is the only country in the world that does not use the metric ton. In 2016  the world pumped 36.1 billion metric tons  or 39.8 U.S. Gt  of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The average per capita emission of carbon dioxide is 7 metric tons per person per year. In the year 2100  there will be about 11 billion people. Therefore  in 2100  in a business as usual scenario  we can expect the world to emit 11 x 7 or 77 billion metric tons into the atmosphere per year or an average of 56.5 billion tons for the next 80 years  i.e.  an accumulation of 4.52 trillion tons of CO2 by 2300.  Less 25   1.13 Tt  due to carbon sinks  the oceans are almost saturated with CO2   the world will have an accumulation of 3.4Tt  4.52  1.13  of carbon in the atmosphere. Dividing 3.4 trillion tons of CO2 by 975 million   3.48    6.26   .  This means that the world will be 6.26   warmer in 2100 than it was in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in sea level comes from two distinct processes  water expansions  3.3 feet  due to the added 6.26   of increased temperature and melting ice  mainly from Greenland  .41 feet  and the Antarctica  .2 feet  or 3.91 total feet by 2100  as well as increased extraction of groundwater due to irrigation.   Although we do not usually notice it  water expands very slightly as it gets warmer. The second and potentially greater contribution to rising sea level comes from the melting of glacial ice. Antarctica has 90  of the ice  Greenland has 9  of the ice  2 931 trillion tons of ice  and the remaining 1  is tied up in continental glaciers  which except for the Himalayas will all melt by 2100.  If Greenland completely melts  it will raise the sea level by about 24 feet  7.2 meters .  If the Antarctica completely melts  it will add 200 feet  or 60 meters  to the sea level rise.   \n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 2100  I predict that fossil fuels will be almost depleted  coal may last until 2150  and that the temperature rise will level off. My model predicts that Greenland will be losing about 500 Gt of ice per year until the end of the century  resulting in about 0.41 feet of sea level rise by 2100.  In addition  the Antarctica will add another 0.2 feet of sea level rise. Adding this to the 3.3 feet for thermal warming results in a sea level rise of 3.9 feet.  Now add 2 feet due to melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  WAIS  due to the collapse of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers and you have a 5.9 foot sea level rise by the end of the century.  NOAA  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  states that the oceans could rise 8 feet by 2100 under a worse case scenario  namely a complete collapse of the WAIS.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What effect would a 5.9 foot sea level rise have on the U.S.  Miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas. About 2 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded if sea levels rise just 3 feet. If the sea level rises 6 feet  6 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded. A new study predicts that as many as 13.1 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by 2100 if the sea level rises 5.9 feet  1.8 meters   which is what I expect to be the most likely scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to sea level rise  global warming is contributing to increases in the spread of insect borne illnesses and crop damaging pests. For example  diseases such as Zika  dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes  which pick up these diseases by biting infected people and then spreading them to other people through subsequent bites. Research has shown that warmer temperatures shorten the incubation period  which means the disease can spread more rapidly. Warmer temperatures also tend to increase the geographic range of insects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global warming also translates into more extreme weather events because higher temperatures mean an increase in energy in the atmosphere and oceans  energy is what drives weather. While we cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming  we can tie an overall trend to global warming. It makes logical sense that warm ocean waters give birth to more intense weather. Generally  hurricanes cannot survive for long over sea surfaces that are cooler than about 79    26   . The longer the ocean waters stay above 79    the more opportunity there is for a hurricane to blossom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly  global warming will result in more droughts  floods and water scarcity.  Demand for water has tripled during the past 50 years. Currently a half billion people live in a water stressed country. By 2025  that number is expected to increase to about 3 billion. The vast majority of fresh water  about 70   is used for agriculture. On the U.S. East Coast  much of the water supply comes from surface water  whereas most of the Midwest gets its water supply from a combination of surface waters and well water. The well water comes from underground aquifers such as the Ogallala Aquifer. At present rates of withdrawal  parts of the Ogallala Aquifer water will be available for irrigation for only another 10 to 20 years.\n",

Why hasn t there ever been a time promoting  no risk effective solution to save planet earth eliminating the amount of emissions on and in the planet just by turning it all off  It is free and results are immediate. Maybe this will not change the amount of emissions in atmosphere from 10 yrs ago but if earth got that rest 1 day a week it will absolutely rejuvenate all that is being used and needed for earth to be more efficient and effective. Stop experimenting with so much uncertainty that is potentially more destructive and jwork on promoting the world to give earth off on Sundays and shut it off  Maybe the results would be miraculous and would heal this planet quicker than we d ever imagine.

If the temperature outside the earth s atmosphere is above the boiling point of water  approx. 120    is it not possible that an increase could affect the atmosphere. Also  heated cosmic radiation could affect the temperature. What comes to mind is the  P  theory. In an outdoor public unheated pool  you come along a warm spot of water.  We all know what that means.  The solar system could be traveling through such a heated radiation cloud. The Milky Way galaxy has chaotic catastrophic events of stellar birth  life and death throughout. Clouds or jets of superheated radiation blasted into space. Well  we might be entering that space. But  closer to home  one just has to look at a frosted window  on a winter morning  as the light from the sun hits it. With temperatures below freezing  the sun s rays melts the frost.

      "It s a positive feedback loop.  \n",
      "\n",
      "When our orbit is in the cooler phase the temperature falls and the CO2 level slowly goes back down.  Cooling off takes longer than warming up. \n",

      "475 The  greenhouse effect  is concerned with the infrared radiation given off by the earth. The sun s radiation basically passes through the oxygen and nitrogen in the earth s atmosphere and lands on the earth s surface  where 70  of it is absorbed  30  is reflected back into the atmosphere. Part of this radiation bounces off the greenhouse gases and returns to be absorbed by earth. The greenhouses gases  GHGs  are water vapor  H2O   carbon dioxide  CO2   nitrous oxide  NO2  and methane  CH4 .\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does CO2 remain in the atmosphere  This is a difficult question because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. From 65  to 80  of the CO2 that is released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of 50 200 years. The rest is removed over several hundred thousand years. According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report  about 50  of CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years  another 30  will be removed within a few centuries and the remaining 20  may stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years. This means that if we could stop carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow  the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue to warm the climate for thousands of years. Methane  CH4   by contrast  persists for about 12 years. Thus  even though methane is 26 times more potent than carbon dioxide  its effect is relatively short lived. Furthermore  methane has increased from 700 ppb in 1750 to 1893 ppb today  notice that is parts per billion  not parts per million.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are causing global warming  how much will the earth warm up by the year 2100  This depends upon how many billions of tons of carbon dioxide are being emitted into the atmosphere. As a general rule  about 1 trillion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  actually 975 billion  will translate to about 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide. Also  125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide translates to about 1.8    1    in global warming. This can be verified by the fact that pre industrial carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm and is now about 405 ppm. During this period  the planet warmed up about 1  .\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists have measured the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which corresponds to 1 ppm and have found that this corresponds to 7.8 billion metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Therefore  in order to increase the global temperature by 1    you would need 125 x 7.8 billion or 975 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. A metric ton equals 1 000 kilograms  or 2.2 x 1 000   2 200 pounds   the U.S. is the only country in the world that does not use the metric ton. In 2016  the world pumped 36.1 billion metric tons  or 39.8 U.S. Gt  of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The average per capita emission of carbon dioxide is 7 metric tons per person per year. In the year 2100  there will be about 11 billion people. Therefore  in 2100  in a business as usual scenario  we can expect the world to emit 11 x 7 or 77 billion metric tons into the atmosphere per year or an average of 56.5 billion tons for the next 80 years  i.e.  an accumulation of 4.52 trillion tons of CO2 by 2300.  Less 25   1.13 Tt  due to carbon sinks  the oceans are almost saturated with CO2   the world will have an accumulation of 3.4Tt  4.52  1.13  of carbon in the atmosphere. Dividing 3.4 trillion tons of CO2 by 975 million   3.48    6.26   .  This means that the world will be 6.26   warmer in 2100 than it was in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in sea level comes from two distinct processes  water expansions  3.3 feet  due to the added 6.26   of increased temperature and melting ice  mainly from Greenland  .41 feet  and the Antarctica  .2 feet  or 3.91 total feet by 2100  as well as increased extraction of groundwater due to irrigation.   Although we do not usually notice it  water expands very slightly as it gets warmer. The second and potentially greater contribution to rising sea level comes from the melting of glacial ice. Antarctica has 90  of the ice  Greenland has 9  of the ice  2 931 trillion tons of ice  and the remaining 1  is tied up in continental glaciers  which except for the Himalayas will all melt by 2100.  If Greenland completely melts  it will raise the sea level by about 24 feet  7.2 meters .  If the Antarctica completely melts  it will add 200 feet  or 60 meters  to the sea level rise.   \n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 2100  I predict that fossil fuels will be almost depleted  coal may last until 2150  and that the temperature rise will level off. My model predicts that Greenland will be losing about 500 Gt of ice per year until the end of the century  resulting in about 0.41 feet of sea level rise by 2100.  In addition  the Antarctica will add another 0.2 feet of sea level rise. Adding this to the 3.3 feet for thermal warming results in a sea level rise of 3.9 feet.  Now add 2 feet due to melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  WAIS  due to the collapse of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers and you have a 5.9 foot sea level rise by the end of the century.  NOAA  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  states that the oceans could rise 8 feet by 2100 under a worse case scenario  namely a complete collapse of the WAIS.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What effect would a 5.9 foot sea level rise have on the U.S.  Miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas. About 2 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded if sea levels rise just 3 feet. If the sea level rises 6 feet  6 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded. A new study predicts that as many as 13.1 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by 2100 if the sea level rises 5.9 feet  1.8 meters   which is what I expect to be the most likely scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to sea level rise  global warming is contributing to increases in the spread of insect borne illnesses and crop damaging pests. For example  diseases such as Zika  dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes  which pick up these diseases by biting infected people and then spreading them to other people through subsequent bites. Research has shown that warmer temperatures shorten the incubation period  which means the disease can spread more rapidly. Warmer temperatures also tend to increase the geographic range of insects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global warming also translates into more extreme weather events because higher temperatures mean an increase in energy in the atmosphere and oceans  energy is what drives weather. While we cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming  we can tie an overall trend to global warming. It makes logical sense that warm ocean waters give birth to more intense weather. Generally  hurricanes cannot survive for long over sea surfaces that are cooler than about 79    26   . The longer the ocean waters stay above 79    the more opportunity there is for a hurricane to blossom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly  global warming will result in more droughts  floods and water scarcity.  Demand for water has tripled during the past 50 years. Currently a half billion people live in a water stressed country. By 2025  that number is expected to increase to about 3 billion. The vast majority of fresh water  about 70   is used for agriculture. On the U.S. East Coast  much of the water supply comes from surface water  whereas most of the Midwest gets its water supply from a combination of surface waters and well water. The well water comes from underground aquifers such as the Ogallala Aquifer. At present rates of withdrawal  parts of the Ogallala Aquifer water will be available for irrigation for only another 10 to 20 years.\n",
      "476 Is CO2 Earth s Thermostat \n",
      "Carbon dioxide has little or nothing to do with global warming. CO2 Is currently traced at 400 ppm. That is one carbon dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of the atmosphere. Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm  which is 4  of the total CO2 accumulated in a year. CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds  and there is not enough of it to drive climate change. It is thermodynamically impossible \n",
      "Also  bear in mind  that water vapor is the earth s most abundant and effective Greenhouse Gas. CO2 is only 5  of the earth s CHG. Water vapor is 95  of the earth s GHG and holds heat far longer than CO2.\n",
      "Lastly  CO2 will increase only after temperatures rise  eg. El Nino  and oceans degas. Conversely  CO2 levels drop as temperatures cool. In other words  CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack thereof and therefore do not drive climate but follow climate.\n",
      "Clearly  CO2 is actually a thermometer and not a thermostat \n",

      "45 The  greenhouse effect  is concerned with the infrared radiation given off by the earth. The sun s radiation basically passes through the oxygen and nitrogen in the earth s atmosphere and lands on the earth s surface  where 70  of it is absorbed  30  is reflected back into the atmosphere. Part of this radiation bounces off the greenhouse gases and returns to be absorbed by earth. The greenhouses gases  GHGs  are water vapor  H2O   carbon dioxide  CO2   nitrous oxide  NO2  and methane  CH4 .\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does CO2 remain in the atmosphere  This is a difficult question because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. From 65  to 80  of the CO2 that is released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of 50 200 years. The rest is removed over several hundred thousand years. According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report  about 50  of CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years  another 30  will be removed within a few centuries and the remaining 20  may stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years. This means that if we could stop carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow  the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue to warm the climate for thousands of years. Methane  CH4   by contrast  persists for about 12 years. Thus  even though methane is 26 times more potent than carbon dioxide  its effect is relatively short lived. Furthermore  methane has increased from 700 ppb in 1750 to 1893 ppb today  notice that is parts per billion  not parts per million.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are causing global warming  how much will the earth warm up by the year 2100  This depends upon how many billions of tons of carbon dioxide are being emitted into the atmosphere. As a general rule  about 1 trillion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  actually 975 billion  will translate to about 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide. Also  125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide translates to about 1.8    1    in global warming. This can be verified by the fact that pre industrial carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm and is now about 405 ppm. During this period  the planet warmed up about 1  .\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists have measured the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which corresponds to 1 ppm and have found that this corresponds to 7.8 billion metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Therefore  in order to increase the global temperature by 1    you would need 125 x 7.8 billion or 975 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. A metric ton equals 1 000 kilograms  or 2.2 x 1 000   2 200 pounds   the U.S. is the only country in the world that does not use the metric ton. In 2016  the world pumped 36.1 billion metric tons  or 39.8 U.S. Gt  of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The average per capita emission of carbon dioxide is 7 metric tons per person per year. In the year 2100  there will be about 11 billion people. Therefore  in 2100  in a business as usual scenario  we can expect the world to emit 11 x 7 or 77 billion metric tons into the atmosphere per year or an average of 56.5 billion tons for the next 80 years  i.e.  an accumulation of 4.52 trillion tons of CO2 by 2300.  Less 25   1.13 Tt  due to carbon sinks  the oceans are almost saturated with CO2   the world will have an accumulation of 3.4Tt  4.52  1.13  of carbon in the atmosphere. Dividing 3.4 trillion tons of CO2 by 975 million   3.48    6.26   .  This means that the world will be 6.26   warmer in 2100 than it was in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in sea level comes from two distinct processes  water expansions  3.3 feet  due to the added 6.26   of increased temperature and melting ice  mainly from Greenland  .41 feet  and the Antarctica  .2 feet  or 3.91 total feet by 2100  as well as increased extraction of groundwater due to irrigation.   Although we do not usually notice it  water expands very slightly as it gets warmer. The second and potentially greater contribution to rising sea level comes from the melting of glacial ice. Antarctica has 90  of the ice  Greenland has 9  of the ice  2 931 trillion tons of ice  and the remaining 1  is tied up in continental glaciers  which except for the Himalayas will all melt by 2100.  If Greenland completely melts  it will raise the sea level by about 24 feet  7.2 meters .  If the Antarctica completely melts  it will add 200 feet  or 60 meters  to the sea level rise.   \n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 2100  I predict that fossil fuels will be almost depleted  coal may last until 2150  and that the temperature rise will level off. My model predicts that Greenland will be losing about 500 Gt of ice per year until the end of the century  resulting in about 0.41 feet of sea level rise by 2100.  In addition  the Antarctica will add another 0.2 feet of sea level rise. Adding this to the 3.3 feet for thermal warming results in a sea level rise of 3.9 feet.  Now add 2 feet due to melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  WAIS  due to the collapse of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers and you have a 5.9 foot sea level rise by the end of the century.  NOAA  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  states that the oceans could rise 8 feet by 2100 under a worse case scenario  namely a complete collapse of the WAIS.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What effect would a 5.9 foot sea level rise have on the U.S.  Miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas. About 2 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded if sea levels rise just 3 feet. If the sea level rises 6 feet  6 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded. A new study predicts that as many as 13.1 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by 2100 if the sea level rises 5.9 feet  1.8 meters   which is what I expect to be the most likely scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to sea level rise  global warming is contributing to increases in the spread of insect borne illnesses and crop damaging pests. For example  diseases such as Zika  dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes  which pick up these diseases by biting infected people and then spreading them to other people through subsequent bites. Research has shown that warmer temperatures shorten the incubation period  which means the disease can spread more rapidly. Warmer temperatures also tend to increase the geographic range of insects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global warming also translates into more extreme weather events because higher temperatures mean an increase in energy in the atmosphere and oceans  energy is what drives weather. While we cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming  we can tie an overall trend to global warming. It makes logical sense that warm ocean waters give birth to more intense weather. Generally  hurricanes cannot survive for long over sea surfaces that are cooler than about 79    26   . The longer the ocean waters stay above 79    the more opportunity there is for a hurricane to blossom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly  global warming will result in more droughts  floods and water scarcity.  Demand for water has tripled during the past 50 years. Currently a half billion people live in a water stressed country. By 2025  that number is expected to increase to about 3 billion. The vast majority of fresh water  about 70   is used for agriculture. On the U.S. East Coast  much of the water supply comes from surface water  whereas most of the Midwest gets its water supply from a combination of surface waters and well water. The well water comes from underground aquifers such as the Ogallala Aquifer. At present rates of withdrawal  parts of the Ogallala Aquifer water will be available for irrigation for only another 10 to 20 years.\n",

The only requirement needed for this to happen and become a reality is rest. The world is spending billions on UNCERTAINTY to save this planet trying to cool it but cooling it is not changing the amount of emissions on earth or in the atmosphere. Watching and reading all that is being attempted and done is like watching the movie groundhog day. Trial and error unknown results uncertainty knowing the damage and destruction and doing it anyway. Repeat again and again and again. Why hasn t there ever been a time promoting  no risk effective solution to save planet earth eliminating the amount of emissions on and in the planet just by turning it all off  It is free and results are immediate. Maybe this will not change the amount of emissions in atmosphere from 10 yrs ago but if earth got that rest 1 day a week it will absolutely rejuvenate all that is being used and needed for earth to be more efficient and effective. Stop experimenting with so much uncertainty that is potentially more destructive and jwork on promoting the world to give earth off on Sundays and shut it off  Maybe the results would be miraculous and would heal this planet quicker than we d ever imagine. We will never know until it s done. Make that your great experiment to save the planet.

If the temperature outside the earth s atmosphere is above the boiling point of water  approx. 120    is it not possible that an increase could affect the atmosphere. Also  heated cosmic radiation could affect the temperature. What comes to mind is the  P  theory. In an outdoor public unheated pool  you come along a warm spot of water.  We all know what that means.  The solar system could be traveling through such a heated radiation cloud. The Milky Way galaxy has chaotic catastrophic events of stellar birth  life and death throughout. Clouds or jets of superheated radiation blasted into space. Well  we might be entering that space. But  closer to home  one just has to look at a frosted window  on a winter morning  as the light from the sun hits it. With temperatures below freezing  the sun s rays melts the frost.

      "It s a positive feedback loop.  \n",
      "\n",
      "When our orbit is in the cooler phase the temperature falls and the CO2 level slowly goes back down.  Cooling off takes longer than warming up. \n",

      "475 The  greenhouse effect  is concerned with the infrared radiation given off by the earth. The sun s radiation basically passes through the oxygen and nitrogen in the earth s atmosphere and lands on the earth s surface  where 70  of it is absorbed  30  is reflected back into the atmosphere. Part of this radiation bounces off the greenhouse gases and returns to be absorbed by earth. The greenhouses gases  GHGs  are water vapor  H2O   carbon dioxide  CO2   nitrous oxide  NO2  and methane  CH4 .\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does CO2 remain in the atmosphere  This is a difficult question because there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. From 65  to 80  of the CO2 that is released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of 50 200 years. The rest is removed over several hundred thousand years. According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report  about 50  of CO2 increase will be removed from the atmosphere within 30 years  another 30  will be removed within a few centuries and the remaining 20  may stay in the atmosphere for thousands of years. This means that if we could stop carbon dioxide emissions tomorrow  the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would continue to warm the climate for thousands of years. Methane  CH4   by contrast  persists for about 12 years. Thus  even though methane is 26 times more potent than carbon dioxide  its effect is relatively short lived. Furthermore  methane has increased from 700 ppb in 1750 to 1893 ppb today  notice that is parts per billion  not parts per million.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere are causing global warming  how much will the earth warm up by the year 2100  This depends upon how many billions of tons of carbon dioxide are being emitted into the atmosphere. As a general rule  about 1 trillion tons of additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  actually 975 billion  will translate to about 125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide. Also  125 ppm of additional carbon dioxide translates to about 1.8    1    in global warming. This can be verified by the fact that pre industrial carbon dioxide was about 280 ppm and is now about 405 ppm. During this period  the planet warmed up about 1  .\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists have measured the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which corresponds to 1 ppm and have found that this corresponds to 7.8 billion metric tons of CO2 in the atmosphere. Therefore  in order to increase the global temperature by 1    you would need 125 x 7.8 billion or 975 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. A metric ton equals 1 000 kilograms  or 2.2 x 1 000   2 200 pounds   the U.S. is the only country in the world that does not use the metric ton. In 2016  the world pumped 36.1 billion metric tons  or 39.8 U.S. Gt  of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The average per capita emission of carbon dioxide is 7 metric tons per person per year. In the year 2100  there will be about 11 billion people. Therefore  in 2100  in a business as usual scenario  we can expect the world to emit 11 x 7 or 77 billion metric tons into the atmosphere per year or an average of 56.5 billion tons for the next 80 years  i.e.  an accumulation of 4.52 trillion tons of CO2 by 2300.  Less 25   1.13 Tt  due to carbon sinks  the oceans are almost saturated with CO2   the world will have an accumulation of 3.4Tt  4.52  1.13  of carbon in the atmosphere. Dividing 3.4 trillion tons of CO2 by 975 million   3.48    6.26   .  This means that the world will be 6.26   warmer in 2100 than it was in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in sea level comes from two distinct processes  water expansions  3.3 feet  due to the added 6.26   of increased temperature and melting ice  mainly from Greenland  .41 feet  and the Antarctica  .2 feet  or 3.91 total feet by 2100  as well as increased extraction of groundwater due to irrigation.   Although we do not usually notice it  water expands very slightly as it gets warmer. The second and potentially greater contribution to rising sea level comes from the melting of glacial ice. Antarctica has 90  of the ice  Greenland has 9  of the ice  2 931 trillion tons of ice  and the remaining 1  is tied up in continental glaciers  which except for the Himalayas will all melt by 2100.  If Greenland completely melts  it will raise the sea level by about 24 feet  7.2 meters .  If the Antarctica completely melts  it will add 200 feet  or 60 meters  to the sea level rise.   \n",
      "\n",
      "In the year 2100  I predict that fossil fuels will be almost depleted  coal may last until 2150  and that the temperature rise will level off. My model predicts that Greenland will be losing about 500 Gt of ice per year until the end of the century  resulting in about 0.41 feet of sea level rise by 2100.  In addition  the Antarctica will add another 0.2 feet of sea level rise. Adding this to the 3.3 feet for thermal warming results in a sea level rise of 3.9 feet.  Now add 2 feet due to melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet  WAIS  due to the collapse of the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers and you have a 5.9 foot sea level rise by the end of the century.  NOAA  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  states that the oceans could rise 8 feet by 2100 under a worse case scenario  namely a complete collapse of the WAIS.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What effect would a 5.9 foot sea level rise have on the U.S.  Miami is one of the most vulnerable places to rising seas. About 2 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded if sea levels rise just 3 feet. If the sea level rises 6 feet  6 million Americans would see their homes permanently flooded. A new study predicts that as many as 13.1 million Americans in coastal areas will have to relocate by 2100 if the sea level rises 5.9 feet  1.8 meters   which is what I expect to be the most likely scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to sea level rise  global warming is contributing to increases in the spread of insect borne illnesses and crop damaging pests. For example  diseases such as Zika  dengue fever and chikungunya are transmitted by mosquitoes  which pick up these diseases by biting infected people and then spreading them to other people through subsequent bites. Research has shown that warmer temperatures shorten the incubation period  which means the disease can spread more rapidly. Warmer temperatures also tend to increase the geographic range of insects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global warming also translates into more extreme weather events because higher temperatures mean an increase in energy in the atmosphere and oceans  energy is what drives weather. While we cannot attribute any particular storm to global warming  we can tie an overall trend to global warming. It makes logical sense that warm ocean waters give birth to more intense weather. Generally  hurricanes cannot survive for long over sea surfaces that are cooler than about 79    26   . The longer the ocean waters stay above 79    the more opportunity there is for a hurricane to blossom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly  global warming will result in more droughts  floods and water scarcity.  Demand for water has tripled during the past 50 years. Currently a half billion people live in a water stressed country. By 2025  that number is expected to increase to about 3 billion. The vast majority of fresh water  about 70   is used for agriculture. On the U.S. East Coast  much of the water supply comes from surface water  whereas most of the Midwest gets its water supply from a combination of surface waters and well water. The well water comes from underground aquifers such as the Ogallala Aquifer. At present rates of withdrawal  parts of the Ogallala Aquifer water will be available for irrigation for only another 10 to 20 years.\n",
      "476 Is CO2 Earth s Thermostat \n",
      "Carbon dioxide has little or nothing to do with global warming. CO2 Is currently traced at 400 ppm. That is one carbon dioxide molecule for every 2500 parts of the atmosphere. Humans contribute only a scant 16 ppm  which is 4  of the total CO2 accumulated in a year. CO2 only holds heat for a few seconds  and there is not enough of it to drive climate change. It is thermodynamically impossible \n",
      "Also  bear in mind  that water vapor is the earth s most abundant and effective Greenhouse Gas. CO2 is only 5  of the earth s CHG. Water vapor is 95  of the earth s GHG and holds heat far longer than CO2.\n",
      "Lastly  CO2 will increase only after temperatures rise  eg. El Nino  and oceans degas. Conversely  CO2 levels drop as temperatures cool. In other words  CO2 levels are influenced by heat or the lack thereof and therefore do not drive climate but follow climate.\n",
      "Clearly  CO2 is actually a thermometer and not a thermostat \n",
